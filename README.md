# Algorithms

These files are from my various courses/problem-solving tests. 

The leetcode note is some of my solutions to leetcode medium level programming tests and they all pass with a reasonable time-complexity (usually, I will optimize my algorithm so that it ranked in the top 50% in submission).

The island simulation is my first use of python to solve problems via simulations. I met the problem when taking a test online and continued to try to solve it mathematically and failed. Either there is an ingenius way to approach it as my fellow graduate students were also unable to solve it, or they original problem was not properly phrased. Anyway, simulation turns out to be easy to implement and fast to run.
